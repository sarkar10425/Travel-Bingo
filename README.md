# Travel-Bingo
It is an implementation of a part of a travel website where users can select their desired cities from the landing page and then search for their desired activities/adventures based on time range of adventures and also based on activities of the adventure. They can also view the details of that adventure and also book it if it is available. Finally they can see their reservations on the final reservations page.
